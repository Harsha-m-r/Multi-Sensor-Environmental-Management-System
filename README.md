## Abstract
In this project, we aimed to address and mitigate the challenges faced by workers in a nut and bolt manufacturing factory through the implementation of sustainable energy solutions and advanced sensor technologies. Our primary focus was on enhancing workplace safety, comfort, and energy efficiency. We installed solar panels to harness renewable energy, significantly reducing the factory's dependency on non-renewable power sources and lowering overall energy costs.

To further optimize energy usage and improve working conditions, we integrated several smart sensors into the factory's infrastructure. Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) were used to automate the lighting system, ensuring lights are only on when necessary and conserving energy. Thermostats are used to monitor ambient temperature and control exhaust fans, maintaining an optimal working environment by regulating temperature and ventilation. Additionally, MQ2 gas sensors are used to detect smoke, automatically activating a buzzer/siren. This proactive approach safeguards workers from potential health risks.

Through these innovations, our project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to improving industrial working conditions by leveraging sustainable energy and intelligent sensor technology. The implementation of these solutions showcases a practical and scalable model for other manufacturing units aiming to enhance worker well-being and operational efficiency while promoting environmental sustainability.
